# Fully-Expanded-Einstein-Field-Equations
The Einsten Field Equations describe how the metric (technically the metric tensor field) is related to the stress-energy tensor on a manifold. The equation is usually presented as $\kappa T_{uv}=G_{uv}+\Lambda g_{uv}$, but that isn't the full story. The 'G' is actually a shorthand for the Einstein Tensor, which represents a much larger expression. In fact, the full expression is so long that I can't seem to find it anywhere on the internet!
   
I've been working on a project recently, and the full equation was an interesting side product of it. Since I couldn't find it anywhere else, I wanted to put this out there. Of course, I don't have any way to double check the results, so use this at your own risk. Also, I'm not sure if there's any way to render Latex on Github, so if you want to see the full pdf you can use something like TeXShop to render it.
